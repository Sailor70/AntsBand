# AntsBand

AntsBand is an application that uses ant colony optimisation algorithms to the task of composing music.
This application was implemented in Python and it allows you, based on the loaded midi file, to generate new melodies played on various instruments. 
The project also includes scripts for conducting research on the implemented system.
This project was developed as part of my thesis at IT studies.
